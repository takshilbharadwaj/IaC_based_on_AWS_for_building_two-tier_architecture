Things I can add to the IaC setup:

Security: 
  -- Currently using AWS service user with Administrative access, as it will take bit of time to narrow down the IAM scope just to services being deployed.
  -- Implement WAF rules to secure the server from unwanted traffic/DDoS attacks, etc, e.g. rate limit rules, etc.

Monitoring: Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor the health and performance of the application.

Logging: Enable logging for the web server and RDS instance for troubleshooting and auditing.
Notification for CFN stack: Setup SNS topic to confirm if the stack was updated successfully or not.

Modularity: Increase modularity for the stack to avoid human errors while updating the templates.

Debugging: Debugging for AWS CLI command needs to be implemented in order to have clarity of the run if any failure.

Multi region deployment: As part of MVP, I didn't find it important, but can definitely be implemented.

Template Versioning: As part of rollback/mitigation, versioning for templates should be implemented.

Implement StackSet instead of Stack: This will let me redeploy all these resources with ease in multiple regions.
